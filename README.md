This is my personal build for the tern-ble, thanks to 
- [gleb](https://gitlab.com/gleb_sexy/tern-ble) for making the Tern wireless
- [Tern](https://github.com/rschenk/tern/) for the original Tern keyboard
- [Hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) for the original idea and matrix
- [Rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae) for the basis of the Ergogen config and routing

And much thanks to Ryan Schenk for also making the gorgeous Re-gret, which scratches so many itches, but got me considering ever-smaller keyboards.

This has my keymap using Callum-style home-row mods. I'll be making a copy and try out a HandsDown layout.
